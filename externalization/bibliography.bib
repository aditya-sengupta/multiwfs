abstract="Explicit model predictive control (MPC) addresses the problem of removing one of the main drawbacks of MPC, namely the need to solve a mathematical program on line to compute the control action. This computation prevents the application of MPC in several contexts, either because the computer technology needed to solve the optimization problem within the sampling time is too expensive or simply infeasible, or because the computer code implementing the numerical solver causes software certification concerns,especially in safety critical applications.",
